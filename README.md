# Project: Airbnb Analysis

My project is a data analysis and visualization tool for Airbnb data stored in a MongoDB database. The project is implemented using Python with the help of libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, Streamlit, and others. It provides an interactive web application where users can explore and analyze Airbnb data. Here's a brief explanation of the project:

# Data Source:
- The project uses Airbnb data stored in a MongoDB database.
- The data includes information such as property names, types, prices, room types, number of reviews, review scores, host information, and location details.
# Data Preparation:
- Data is fetched from the MongoDB collection and processed into a Pandas DataFrame.
- The DataFrame undergoes cleaning and formatting, including handling missing values and converting data types.
# Streamlit Application:
- The application uses Streamlit to create an interactive web interface for exploring and visualizing the data.
- Users can navigate through different pages, such as the home page and data visualization page.
# Data Visualizations:
- The project provides several visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, and choropleth maps.
- Visualizations include top property types by reviews, average prices by property type, and top properties with the highest review scores for cleanliness.
- Users can filter data based on criteria such as country, price range, number of beds, bedrooms, and cancellation policy.
# Bar Charts:
Purpose: Bar charts are useful for comparing the frequency or value of different categories. In the context of Airbnb analysis, you might use bar charts to compare the number of reviews or average price for different property types.
- Use Case: Visualize the top 10 property types in a selected country by number of reviews.
# Pie Charts:
Purpose: Pie charts are effective for displaying proportions or percentages of a whole. In Airbnb analysis, you could use pie charts to show the distribution of different property types or review scores for cleanliness.
- Use Case: Display the top 5 property types with the highest review scores for cleanliness in a selected country.
# Choropleth Maps:
Purpose: Choropleth maps allow you to visualize data geographically. In Airbnb analysis, this can be used to represent the average price of listings across different countries or regions.
- Use Case: Display the average price by country to identify geographic areas with higher or lower prices.
# User Interaction:
- Users can interact with the data and visualizations by selecting options from dropdown menus, sliders, and other input elements.
- These interactions allow users to customize their analysis and focus on specific aspects of the data.
# Results:
- The application provides insights into Airbnb listings, such as popular property types, pricing trends, and cleanliness scores.
- These insights can be valuable for both Airbnb hosts and guests.
